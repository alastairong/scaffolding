import { HappDefinition } from '../../types';

export default (happ: HappDefinition) => `
# ${happ.name}

## Installation

1. Install the holochain dev environment (only nix-shell is required): https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/
2. Clone this repo and \`cd\` inside of it.
3. Enter the nix shell by running this in the root folder of the repository: 

\`\`\`bash
nix-shell
npm install
\`\`\`

This will install all the needed dependencies in your local environment, including \`holochain\`, \`hc\` and \`npm\`.

> Warning! This can take a lot of time the first time, afterwards your environment will be cached so it will be instantanious.

## Building the DNA

- Build the DNA (assumes you are still in the nix shell for correct rust/cargo versions from step above):

\`\`\`bash
npm run build:happ
\`\`\`

## Running the DNA tests

\`\`\`bash
npm run test
\`\`\`

## UI

To test out the UI:

\`\`\` bash
npm run start
\`\`\`

## Package

To package the web happ:

\`\`\` bash
npm run package
\`\`\`

You'll have the \`${happ.name}.webhapp\` in \`workdir\`. You will also have its subcomponent \`${happ.name}.happ\` in the same folder\`.

## Releasing

At every commit in the \`main\` branch, a release process will be triggered. It will create a draft release with your app packaged in the \`.webhapp\` file, ready to be installed in the launcher.

You can customize this behaviour by going into \`.github/workflows/release.yml\`.
