Small zome to manage the ${moduleNamePlural} in your DNA, in RSM.

This module is designed to be included in other DNAs, assuming as little as possible from those. It is packaged as a holochain zome, and an npm package that offers native Web Components that can be used across browsers and frameworks.

> Notice that this zome still stores all ${moduleNamePlural} in the DNA in which the zome is included. Integration and bridging with personas & ${moduleNamePlural} will be done in the future, maintaining as much as possible the current API.

## Documentation
