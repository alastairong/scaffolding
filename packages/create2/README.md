# @holochain-open-dev/create

RAD tool to rapidly scaffold Holochain modules.

To execute this, run:

```bash
npm init @holochain-open-dev [SINGULAR_ITEM] [PLURAL_ITEMS]
```

Both `SINGULAR_ITEM` and `PLURAL_ITEMS` need to be in kebab-case.

Example:

```bash
npm init @holochain-open-dev resource-booking resource-booking
```


If you want to make sure you are running the latest version, run this before running `npm init @holochain-open-dev`:

```bash
npx clear-npx-cache
```
